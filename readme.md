## About the Project

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project allows you to encode and decode messages using this cipher technique.

## Features

- Encode messages by shifting letters up the alphabet.
- Decode messages by shifting letters down the alphabet.
- Handles cases where the shift amount exceeds the length of the alphabet.
- Maintains non-alphabet characters as they are.

## Getting Started

Just fork the project and you're good to go.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation
